# TataCliq Integration for E-Commerce Filter Saver

## Overview
TataCliq support has been successfully added to the E-Commerce Filter Saver browser extension. Users can now save and apply filters across Myntra, Ajio, Amazon, Flipkart, and TataCliq.

## What's New

### 1. Manifest Updates
- Added `*://*.tatacliq.com/*` to host_permissions
- Added `*://*.tatacliq.com/*` to content_scripts matches
- Updated description to include TataCliq

### 2. Filter Detection (getTataCliqFilters)
The extension can now detect applied filters on TataCliq:

#### Brand Filters
- Detects selected brands from `.FilterSelect__contentSelected` elements
- Handles brand modal (`ShowBrandModal__brandNameHolder`) with checked items
- Differentiates between brands and other filter types using section headers

#### Color Filters  
- Detects selected colors from `.ColourSelectPLP__textHolderActive` elements
- Extracts color names from element IDs (e.g., `filter-color-Black` â†’ `Black`)

#### Size Filters
- Detects selected sizes that match patterns like `UK/IND-2`, `EURO-44`, or numeric values
- Handles both visible and modal-based size selections

### 3. Filter Application (applyTataCliqFilters)
The extension can now apply saved filters to TataCliq:

#### Brand Application
1. Searches for brand section using `.FilterDesktop__newFilterBlock` with "Brand" header
2. Attempts to find brand in visible list first
3. If not found, clicks the "more" button (`#filter-brand-view-more`) to open modal
4. Searches and selects brand in modal (`ShowBrandModal__brandNameHolder`)
5. Closes modal using `.ShowBrandModal__footerElement .Button__base`

#### Color Application
1. Expands color section if needed using `#color-filter-accordion`
2. Clicks specific color elements using `#filter-color-{colorName}` IDs
3. Verifies selection by checking for `.ColourSelectPLP__textHolderActive`

#### Size Application
1. Searches through `.FilterSelect__item` elements
2. Matches exact size text (e.g., "UK/IND-2", "UK/IND-4")
3. Clicks checkbox if not already selected

## How It Works

### Filter Detection Process
1. **Page Load**: Extension waits for TataCliq filter elements to load
2. **Brand Detection**: Scans for selected brands in both main list and modal
3. **Color Detection**: Identifies selected colors by their active state classes
4. **Size Detection**: Finds selected sizes by checking selection state and text patterns

### Filter Application Process
1. **Normalization**: Converts saved filters to standard format
2. **Cross-Site Application**: Uses `applyCrossSiteFilters` for consistent handling
3. **Retry Logic**: Implements retry mechanism for failed filter applications
4. **Toast Notifications**: Shows unmatched filters to user

### HTML Structure Support
The implementation handles TataCliq's specific HTML structure:

```html
<!-- Brand Section -->
<div class="FilterDesktop__newFilterBlock">
  <div class="Accordion__headText">Brand</div>
  <div class="FilterSelect__item">
    <div class="FilterSelect__contentSelected"> <!-- Selected state -->
      <div class="FilterSelect__data">Brand Name</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<!-- Color Section -->
<div class="ColourSelectPLP__base" id="filter-color-Black">
  <div class="ColourSelectPLP__textHolderActive"> <!-- Selected state -->
</div>

<!-- Size Section -->
<div class="FilterSelect__item">
  <div class="FilterSelect__contentSelected"> <!-- Selected state -->
    <div class="FilterSelect__data">UK/IND-2</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Load the Extension
1. Open Chrome/Edge browser
2. Go to `chrome://extensions/` 
3. Enable "Developer mode"
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the extension folder
5. Verify TataCliq permissions are granted

### 2. Test Filter Saving
1. Go to https://www.tatacliq.com/
2. Navigate to any product category (e.g., shoes, clothing)
3. Apply some filters:
   - Select 2-3 brands (e.g., "7-10", "Aady Austin")
   - Select 2-3 colors (e.g., "Black", "Beige")  
   - Select 2-3 sizes (e.g., "UK/IND-2", "UK/IND-4")
4. Click the extension popup
5. Click "Save Current Filters"
6. Give it a name and save

### 3. Test Filter Application
1. Clear all filters on TataCliq
2. Go to a different product category or refresh the page
3. Click the extension popup
4. Select a saved filter and click "Apply"
5. Verify that the correct filters are applied
6. Check for toast notifications about unmatched filters

### 4. Test Cross-Site Application
1. Save filters on TataCliq
2. Go to another supported site (Myntra, Ajio, Amazon, Flipkart)
3. Try applying the TataCliq filters
4. Verify that matching filters are applied and unmatched ones are shown in toast

## Technical Implementation Details

### Error Handling
- Implements retry logic with 3 attempts per filter
- Handles modal timeouts and closing
- Provides detailed console logging for debugging
- Shows user-friendly toast notifications for failures

### Performance Optimizations
- Waits for page elements before attempting operations
- Uses targeted selectors for efficient DOM queries
- Implements delays between filter applications to avoid overwhelming the page
- Caches DOM queries where possible

### Cross-Site Compatibility
- Normalizes filter formats across different sites
- Handles different filter naming conventions
- Provides fallback mechanisms for unmatched filters
- Maintains consistency with existing site implementations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **"Could not establish connection" error**: Refresh the TataCliq page and try again
2. **Filters not applying**: Check browser console for detailed error messages
3. **Modal not opening**: Ensure the "more" button is visible and clickable
4. **Partial filter application**: Check toast notification for unmatched filters

### Debug Information
- All operations are logged to browser console with `[Content Script]` prefix
- Filter detection and application steps are logged in detail
- Error messages include specific failure reasons and retry attempts

## Future Enhancements
- Support for additional filter types (price range, ratings, etc.)
- Improved text matching algorithms for cross-site compatibility
- Better handling of dynamic content loading
- Enhanced user feedback and progress indicators
